 VB: Language
		=>Rules & Law 
		=>Translator
				Interprator:Line By Line Translat(VBA)
				Compiler :Whole Line translate at a time

									 9 : integer
							string 
						           Combination of char is called string

									'kumar@'
									
									
									
		=>Variable : is a memory location where we will can store our 
		data/value								
		
		
How To Create variable in vba :

		Dim VariableName(Whic is user define) as a Datatype
		Note: Here "Dim" is a resureved Key in VBA
		Dim x as a integer
		Dim x as a float
		Dim x as a double
		
		Dim x as a char
		Dim x as a string 
		
		Variable define Correct Way 
			
			=>First letter of variable should be small
				Ex:
				studentName
			=>Not Use any speical char as first letter
				Ex:
				@name(Wrong)
				name@
				student_name
				student-name
			=>Not Use any number as first letter
				Ex:
					9k(Wrong)
					k9(Right)

=>Store /Assign value on Variable

	Dim x as integer

	x=10 (Use assignment operator we can store our value)


How to Use Store Value 

			=>Dispaly 
					MsgBox()(Open PopUp )
